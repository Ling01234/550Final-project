# Ideas
1. create abstract syntax trees from functions
2. Obtain paths of the AST
3. Preprocess dataset
4. use AST to create code vectors
5. Using directed acyclic graphs might improve model performance
6. Implementation of acyclic graphs vs AST

# changes
1. use only python codes
2. use transformers instead of LSTM

# preprocessing
1. generic variable names
2. generic function names


# TEsting ideas
1. use chat gpt to generate many similar functions, and evaluate the difference of vectors
2. Set a threshold with cosine similarity to check whether a prediction is "correct" or not.
